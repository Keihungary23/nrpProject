  " Google hereby grants permission to produce the tables and figures in this paper solely for use in journalistic or scholarly works . We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms .",
  " We propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output . The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in terms of language modeling and machine translation .",
  " The Transformer is the first transduction model relying solely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution . In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9]",
  " We call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2) The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways: in \"encoder-decoder attention\" and \"multi-head\" Attention can be implemented using highly optimized mathematical multiplication code .",
  " The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways . In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous layer of the encoder . This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence . Each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully-connected feed-forward network, applied to each position separately .",
  " In order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the signal in the sequence . In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies: . The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel as the embeddings so that the two can be summed .",
  " A self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially-executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations . In terms of computational complexity, self attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d . Separable convolutions decrease the complexity of a separable convolutional layer, however, to O(k · n · d + n + d2)",
  " The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the English-to-German and French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost . Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs . The big models were trained for 300,000 steps and step time was 1.0 seconds .",
  " The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used a dropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.3 . The big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the previous state-of-the-art model .",
  " The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing . We trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the controversialPenn Treebank [25] We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting, using the larger high-confidence and Berkley Parsing corpora .",
  " The Transformer is the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention . It replaces recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention . We used a beam size of 21 and α = 0.3 for both WSJ only and semi-supervised setting .",
  " Researchers at the University of Cambridge, Massachusetts, have published a paper on machine-recognition . The paper is the latest in a series of papers published on the open-source Neural-Networking platform . The study is published in the journal ArXiv .",

  " Many of the attention heads exhibit behaviour that seems related to the structure of the sentence structure . The heads clearly learned to perform different tasks . Figure 5: We give two such examples above, from two different heads from the encoder self-attention ."
